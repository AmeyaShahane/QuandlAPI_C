QuandlAPI_C
===========

Quandl API (C/C++) is developed to download numeric data from quandl.com, making it easy for thoese C/C++ developers.

The API is enveloped within a header file: 1) quandl (windows).h for the Windows environment; or 2) quandl (linux).h for the Linux environment.

It is reccommended that users sign up on http://www.quandl.com/users/sign_up, to obtain an authentication token for downloading increased volume of data per day.

1.After downloading the right header file, please include it in your code by:

    //The name by default is quandl (windows).h / quandl (linux).h. 
    //You can change it to quandl.h as follows if you like.
    #include "quandl.h"

2.Now you can verify your account by by following command. This step can be skipped if you don't have an token or your don't want to use it.

    //to register with the authentication token denote by the string "code".
    quandl::auth(code);

3.Then you can download the csv file by specifying the Quandl code.

    //to download the csv file defined by the quandlcode of a stock
    quandl::get(quandlcode);

Alternatively, you can set your preferred values for the available parameters by:

    //to download the file specified by eight parameters:
    //quandlcode -- quandl code for a stock;
    //order -- "asc" / "desc";
    //StartDate -- in the format of YYYY-MM-DD, the date from which prices are recorded; 
    //EndDate -- in the format of YYYY-MM-DD, the date until prices are recorded;
    //transformation -- "cummul" / "diff" / "rdiff" / "normalize" / "cumulative";
    //collapse -- "daily" / "weekly" / "monthly" / "quarterly" / "annual";
    //rows  -- the number of rows to record;
    //type  -- the type of downloaded files ("csv" / "json" / "xml" );
    quandl::get(quandlcode, order, StartDate, EndDate, transformation, collapse, rows, type);
